# Solution to various problems in Udemy for Algorithms &amp; Data Structures in JavaScript

# Data Structures are a way of Organising data that is stored in a computer or database
# Each type of Data structure represents a different way of organising the data
# Have big impact on how performant, quick & efficiently a program runs

# Big-O notation measures number of operations
# Space compexity -
# - Primitives are constant space.
# - Strings require O(n) space(where n is the string length)
# - Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length(for arrays) or the number of keys(for objects)

# Problem Solving Patterns -
# 1. Frequency Counters -
# - This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
# - This can often avoid the need for O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings
# 2. Multiple Pointers -
# - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position & move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.
# - Very efficient for problem solving with minimal space complexity as well.
# 3. Sliding Window -
# - This pattern involves creating a pattern which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
# - Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes(and a new window is created).
# - Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
# 4. Divide & Conquer Pattern
# - This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks & then repeating a process with a subset of data.
# - This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.

# Searching
# - Searching is the process of finding item from the collection/list.

# Sorting
# -Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in the collection(e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.
# Bubble Sort - O(n^2)
# Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
# Selection Sort - O(n^2)
# Merge Sort - O(n*logn)
# Quick Sort - O(n*logn)
# Radix Sort - O(n*logn)
# Comparison - https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms

# Radix Sort - Sorts numbers only.

# Recursion -
# - Used in JSON.parse, JSON.stringify, document.getElementById & DOM traversal algorithms.
# - Used in Object traversals.

# Arrays -
# 1. Indexed in Order.
# 2. Insertion & Deletion can be expensive.
# 3. Can quickly be accessed at a specific index.

# Linked List - 
# 1. Memory Management benefits-
# - Data does not have to be stored together.
# Features -
# 1. Do not have indexes.
# 2. Connected via nodes with a next pointer.
# 3. Random access not allowed.

# 1. Fast at Storing data & not retrieving
# 2. Maintain Head & Tail of LL
# 3. Add/Remove new Node to/from Head/Tail(Time Complexity - O(1))
# 4. Search Linked List(Time Complexity - O(n))

# BIG O - Singly Linked List -
# 1. Insertion - O(1)
# 2. Deletion - O(1) or O(n)
# 3. Searching - O(n)
# 4. Accessing - O(n)

# Hash Table  -
# 1. Access data quickly
